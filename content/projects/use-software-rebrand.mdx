# The Mission

I led the complete rebrand of USE Software—a Queensland-based technology consultancy—from market research through design, development, and sales collateral. The goal was to position them as a modern, trustworthy partner in a crowded market while delivering a performant, scalable web presence that reflects their technical capabilities.

## The Challenge

Technology consultancies in South East Queensland face a credibility problem. Most sites rely on jargon-heavy copy, generic stock imagery, and unclear service descriptions. For a boutique consultancy like USE Software, this creates an opportunity: **stand out by being clear, human, and outcome-focused**.

The team needed a brand refresh that would:
- Position them as approachable experts, not faceless enterprise consultants
- Clearly communicate their two engagement models (Project vs. Provider)
- Support sales conversations with cohesive collateral
- Demonstrate technical capability through the site itself

## Strategy & Insights: Finding the Gap

I researched 20+ local and international technology consultancies using a structured framework, analysing what they do, how they present it, and what makes their sites easy or hard to use. Each competitor was catalogued in Notion with detailed notes.

### What Works (The Do's)
- **Clear service articulation** with outcome-focused language
- **Trust signals** upfront (client logos, case studies, certifications)
- **Humanised brands** (team profiles, values, culture)
- **Strong information hierarchy** with predictable navigation
- **Mobile-first UX** with scannable sections and strategic CTAs

<ProjectImage alt="Screenshot from competitive analysis notes showing highlighting patterns across consultancy websites" src="/static/images/projects/use-rebrand/competitive-analysis.png" showAlt />

### What Fails (The Don'ts)
- Jargon-heavy corporate speak ("synergise", "leverage", "optimise")
- Unclear entry points and confusing navigation
- Generic stock imagery that undermines credibility
- Weak mobile experiences and poor visual hierarchy
- Lack of real outcomes or client stories

### Strategic Positioning
This research became my design brief: USE Software needed to be **the approachable alternative**—clear where others are vague, human where others are corporate, and outcome-driven where others rely on buzzwords.

## From Canvas to Code: The Design System

Inspired by high-end narrative patterns, I implemented a scroll-based journey that guides visitors from problem through solution to contact.

### Figma to Final Build
Every page was prototyped pixel-perfect in Figma before a single line of code was written. I iterated through agile sprints with stakeholders to ensure 100% alignment, reducing downstream rework.

<ProjectImage alt="Split-screen comparison showing Figma design (top) and final website implementation (bottom)" src="/static/images/projects/use-rebrand/figma-vs-live.png" showAlt />

The design system uses **Chakra UI v3's token architecture** as a "Lego brick" approach:

| Layer | Purpose | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **Design Tokens** | Brand foundations | Colour scales, Barlow/Barlow Condensed fonts, animation presets |
| **Text Styles** | Responsive typography | `heading/section`, `heading/sub-section` with breakpoint scaling |
| **Component Recipes** | Reusable patterns | Section layouts, card variants, form fields with slot-based styling |

This architecture mirrors the Figma component library, ensuring pixel-perfect translation from design to code while maintaining scalability.

<ProjectImage alt="Figma design system component variants" src="/static/images/projects/use-rebrand/figma-components.png" showAlt />

### Content-Driven Architecture
Pages are composed from structured configuration objects—functioning like a **website builder's CMS**. Non-technical team members can update copy, metadata, and imagery by editing simple config files without touching layout code.

## Interactive Motion: The Show-Stopping Hero

When potential clients land via Google search, they're greeted with a **seamless animated hero** that immediately demonstrates USE Software's capability to design impactful UI/UX.

<ProjectImage alt="Replay of animated hero section mid-scroll with visible motion blur effects" src="/static/images/projects/use-rebrand/animated-hero-demo-720.gif" showAlt />

### Scroll-Based Storytelling
Each section uses a custom Intersection Observer hook to trigger staggered entrance animations—titles slide up, content fades in with subtle delays, creating a controlled reveal that mirrors high-end narrative design patterns.

The "Our Process" section presents a **scroll-driven progress journey**: as visitors move down the page, each of the six steps highlights in sequence with a progress indicator, giving a clear sense of the engagement flow from first conversation through delivery.

### Accessibility First
Animation preferences are saved site-wide. Users who prefer reduced motion can pause animations once, and their preference persists across all pages and future visits.

## Beyond the Web: Unified Brand Collateral

The rebrand extended beyond the website to **Project and Provider brochures**—PDF collateral supporting sales conversations.

### Extending the Design System to Print
Both brochures were designed in the same Figma file using identical tokens (fonts, colours, grids, iconography), ensuring they feel like a natural extension of the website whether viewed digitally or printed.

<ProjectImage alt="Mockup of Project and Provider brochures laid out side by side showing visual consistency" src="/static/images/projects/use-rebrand/project-brochure.png" showAlt />

### Collaborative Content Development
Copy and messaging were developed collaboratively:
- **Chris** (me): Narrative structure, mission/values framing, and CTAs aligned with brand voice
- **Josh** (Principal Software Consultant): Capabilities, services, and delivery methodologies
- **Sam** (Principal Data Engineer): Problem statements, pain points, and solution/benefits grounding

This division of ownership ensured the brochures reflected **actual capabilities and methodologies**, not generic marketing language.

### Purpose & Strategy
- **Project Brochure**: Positions time-bound, outcome-driven engagements (MVPs, features, prototypes)
- **Provider Brochure**: Frames USE Software as a long-term technology partner for ongoing, flexible support

## Reflections

### What I Learned
This project reinforced that **starting with research changes everything**. Understanding the competitive landscape shaped every decision—from navigation labels to motion design to brochure messaging.

### What Sets This Apart
Most frontend developers don't show print/PDF work. Extending the design system to sales collateral demonstrates I think like a **Product Designer**, not just a developer who implements specs.

The Chakra UI v3 token system proved to be the ideal "Lego brick" approach—centralising styling while keeping components composable and maintainable. Combined with the CMS-like content architecture, the site is **future-proof**: the team can iterate on copy and imagery without destabilising layouts.

### Why It Matters
This case study showcases a **full-stack rebrand process**: research-led strategy, cross-media design systems, and robust implementation. It's not just a website; it's a cohesive brand experience that positions USE Software exactly where they need to be—approachable, trustworthy, and technically capable.
