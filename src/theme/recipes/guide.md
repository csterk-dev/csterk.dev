# Recipes Directory Structure

Chakra provides a way to write CSS-in-JS with better performance, developer experience, and composability. 
One of its key features is the ability to create multi-variant styles with a type-safe runtime API.

Use this directory to define & store component specific styles, recipes, and slot recipes.

It is recommended to use the following naming convention, 
`<component>.recipe.ts`
to reduce ambiguidy when building components using the same name in the `@components` directory.
